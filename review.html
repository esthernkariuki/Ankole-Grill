The architectural layout, seating, ambience, lighting, cutlery, servings, design has been impeccably well thought out and even the mushrooms were excellent! The food was AWESOME! This is surprising considering that we were there on a Saturday night & they almost had no queues! We were extremely well catered to and failed to find such finesse in Kenya! You must go visit them!",
